## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ 
- Rust toolchain (for building the certificate parsing extension)
- uv (recommended package manager)

### Installation

1. **Install Rust** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group dev
   ```

4. **Build the Rust extension**:
   ```bash
   make develop
   ```

5. **Run tests** to verify setup:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

### Development Commands

CertMonitor provides a comprehensive Makefile with unified commands. Run `make help` to see all available commands:

```bash
# 🧪 Primary Development Commands

# Run comprehensive test suite (CI-equivalent)
make test

# Quick code quality checks (format + lint)
make check

# Format code (Python + Rust)
make format

# Lint code (Python + Rust)  
make lint

# Type checking
make typecheck

# 📦 Build and Development

# Build and install for development (Python + Rust)
make develop

# Build release wheel
make wheel

# 📚 Documentation

# Serve documentation locally
make docs

# 🔍 Individual Commands (when needed)

# Python-only commands
make python-format    # Format Python code only
make python-lint      # Lint Python code only

# Rust-only commands  
make rust-format      # Format Rust code only
make rust-lint        # Lint Rust code only

# Quick tests (no quality checks)
make test-quick
```

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Make your changes
2. Run `make format lint` to fix code quality
3. Run `make test` before committing

## 📏 Code Standards

CertMonitor follows strict coding standards to ensure code quality and consistency:

### Python Standards

- **Python Version**: 3.8+ compatible
- **Type Hints**: Required for all functions and methods
- **Formatting**: Use `ruff format` for code formatting
- **Linting**: Use `ruff check` and fix all issues
- **String Formatting**: Use f-strings for string formatting
- **Dependencies**: Standard library only (no external Python dependencies)
- **Documentation**: Docstrings required for all public functions and classes

### Code Quality Requirements

```bash
# Before submitting a PR, ensure these pass:
make format              # Format all code (Python + Rust)
make lint                # Lint all code (Python + Rust)  
make typecheck           # Type checking with mypy
make test                # Run comprehensive test suite

# Or run everything at once:
make test                # Includes all quality checks + tests
```

### Certificate and Crypto Standards

CertMonitor must adhere to the highest standards for certificate and cryptographic operations:

- Support all certificate types, formats, and encodings
- Follow all relevant RFC standards and security best practices
- Maintain compatibility with all major certificate authorities
- Implement robust error handling for edge cases
- Ensure security-first design principles

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite (recommended - CI equivalent)
make test

# Quick tests only (no quality checks)
make test-quick

# Individual test commands (if needed)
uv run pytest                                    # All tests
uv run pytest tests/test_core.py                # Specific test file
uv run pytest --cov=certmonitor --cov-report=html  # With coverage report
uv run pytest tests/test_validators/            # Specific test directory
```

### Comprehensive Testing

The `make test` command runs our full 9-step CI-equivalent test suite:

1. **Python formatting check** - Ensures code is properly formatted
2. **Python linting check** - Catches code quality issues  
3. **Rust formatting check** - Ensures Rust code is properly formatted
4. **Rust linting check** - Runs clippy for Rust code quality
5. **Pytest with coverage** - Runs all tests with 95%+ coverage requirement
6. **Type checking** - Ensures zero mypy errors
7. **Security vulnerability check** - Runs cargo audit for dependency security
8. **Build verification** - Verifies the wheel builds successfully
9. **Quality reporting** - Generates modularization and quality reports

### Pre-Commit Testing

Before committing, always run:
```bash
make test  # Full CI-equivalent testing
```

For faster development iteration:
```bash
make check  # Quick format + lint checks
```

### Test Organization

Tests are organized into logical modules:
- `tests/test_core/` - Core functionality tests
- `tests/test_validators/` - Validator-specific tests  
- `tests/test_protocol_handlers/` - Protocol handler tests
- `tests/test_cipher_algorithms.py` - Cipher algorithm tests

### Writing Tests

- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the existing test patterns and structure
- Aim for high test coverage (current: 98%+)

### Test Requirements

- All new code must have corresponding tests
- Tests must pass on all supported Python versions (3.8-3.13)
- Tests should not require external network access (use mocks)
- Security-related functionality requires extra scrutiny and testing

## 📝 Pull Request Process

2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Make your changes** following the code standards
4. **Write or update tests** for your changes
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Run comprehensive quality checks**:
   ```bash
   make format lint  # Fix formatting and linting issues
   make test         # Run full CI-equivalent test suite
   ```
7. **Verify your changes work** as expected
