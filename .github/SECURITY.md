# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

CertMonitor takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### 🚨 For Sensitive Vulnerabilities

**Please DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.**

Instead, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/bradh/certmonitor/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. We will respond within 48 hours

### 📧 Alternative Reporting

If you cannot use GitHub's private reporting, you can email security issues to:
- **Email**: [security@certmonitor.dev] (if available)
- **Subject**: "CertMonitor Security Vulnerability Report"

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 0.1   | ❌ No              |

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### Certificate Validation

CertMonitor handles sensitive cryptographic operations. Key security considerations:

- **Certificate Chain Validation**: Proper verification of certificate chains
- **Hostname Verification**: Accurate hostname matching algorithms
- **Cipher Suite Validation**: Detection of weak or deprecated ciphers
- **Protocol Version Checking**: Identification of insecure protocol versions
- **Input Validation**: Robust handling of malformed certificates and network data

### Cryptographic Standards

CertMonitor adheres to current cryptographic best practices:

- **TLS Protocol Support**: Modern TLS versions (1.2, 1.3)
- **Certificate Standards**: RFC 5280 (X.509), RFC 6818 (Certificate Updates)
- **Cipher Suites**: Industry-recommended cipher suites only
- **Key Algorithms**: Support for modern key algorithms and sizes
- **Hash Functions**: SHA-256 and stronger hash functions

### Network Security

- **Connection Handling**: Secure socket programming practices
- **Timeout Management**: Appropriate timeout handling to prevent DoS
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information leakage in error messages
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of network resources

## 🛠️ Security Tools and Practices

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI pipeline includes:

- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Bandit**: Python security linting with documented exceptions for security tool functionality
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis security testing
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Manual Security Reviews

- Code review process includes security considerations
- Regular security audits of critical components
- Penetration testing for network-facing functionality

## 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

When contributing code, please consider:

- [ ] Input validation for all external data
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Secure defaults for all configuration options
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Appropriate use of cryptographic functions
- [ ] Memory safety considerations (especially in Rust code)
- [ ] Thread safety for concurrent operations

## 🔐 Secure Development Practices

### Code Review Requirements

- All code changes require review by at least one maintainer
- Security-sensitive changes require review by security-aware maintainer
- No direct commits to main branch

### Dependency Management

- Minimal dependency footprint (standard library preferred)
- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning of all dependencies
- Rust dependencies chosen for security and maintainability

### Testing

- Security test cases for all security-sensitive functionality
- Fuzzing tests for certificate parsing
- Integration tests with various certificate types
- Error condition testing

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Certificate Parsing

- **Rust Extension**: Certificate parsing is handled by a Rust extension for memory safety
- **ASN.1 Parsing**: Uses well-tested `x509-parser` crate
- **Input Validation**: Robust handling of malformed certificates

### Network Operations

- **Socket Programming**: Proper socket handling and cleanup
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Error Propagation**: Careful error handling to avoid information disclosure

### Validation Logic

- **Hostname Matching**: RFC-compliant hostname verification
- **Certificate Chain**: Proper chain validation logic
- **Expiration Checking**: Accurate date/time handling
