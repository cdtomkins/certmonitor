"""
Original test_core.py file - all tests have been successfully modularized.

This file has been kept as a placeholder to maintain project structure.
All original test functionality has been moved to organized modules in test_core/:

- test_initialization.py: Initialization and context manager tests
- test_connection_management.py: Connection and protocol detection tests
- test_certificate_operations.py: Certificate retrieval and processing tests
- test_public_key_operations.py: Public key extraction and validation tests
- test_validation.py: Validation operations and validator execution tests
- test_cipher_operations.py: Cipher operations and TLS protocol information tests
- test_utility_methods.py: Utility methods and data transformation tests
- test_raw_data_operations.py: Raw certificate data retrieval tests

Total modularization: 1533 lines -> 8 organized modules (100% complete)
